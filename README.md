A server needs to exist for the clients to join!

Run one instace of the startServer.java! -- note the port and ip used!! (if you want a diffrent port it can be changed in that file)

run main on each clinet using the ip of the host of the server and the port selected!

now it should run once all 4 players are connected! the first player and third player are on a team and so are the second and forth!

how to play euchre:

first all players select whether they want the trump card in the bottom left. (by ether clicking on it or no thanks)

if nobody wanted that trump card then players must select a trump suit, going around to each player seeing if they want to select a suit -- if not dealer must select one

then play the game!! with normal euchre scoring in the top left!
